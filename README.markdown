# Reveal.js - Slideshow

**OBSOLETE:** replaced by the official slideshow template.

New working version of the template available at: https://github.com/slideshow-templates/slideshow-reveal.js

## What it was

A template which outputed reveal.js presentations using slideshow.

## Slideshow and Textile

Slideshow dropped support for textile in version 3.0.  If you have slides written in Textile which you want to present using this template, my suggestion is using "pandoc":http://pandoc.org/ to convert them to markdown and then use the latest version of slideshow.

If you are nostalgic, you can download version 2 of slideshow, checkout version @slideshow-v2@ of this repo and follow the instructions.
